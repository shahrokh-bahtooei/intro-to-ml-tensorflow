# ND230 Introduction to Machine Learning with TensorFlow Nanodegree Program

Projects and exercises for the Udacity Intro to Machine Learning with TensorFlow course.

## Getting Started

The major problems I've solved during this nanodegree in the format of Jupyter notebooks for Supervised Learning project
and Neural Networks exercises and project can be both viewed and re-run through the following links on Google
Colaboratory and Kaggle platforms. The notebook for Unsupervised Learning project can only be viewed statically‚Äîfor it's
been supposed not to include the licensed datasets.

## Installation

To run the notebooks and scripts in this repo locally on a computer with the _exact_ dependencies, just run the
following commands in a terminal, and open the link it offers at the end for a jupyter notebook:

```sh
python3 -m pip install jupyter-repo2docker
repo2docker https://github.com/shahrokh-bahtooei/intro-to-ml-tensorflow.git
```

Prerequisites:

[![Python 3.6](https://img.shields.io/badge/Python-3.6+-blue.svg)](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-360/)
[![Docker](https://badgen.net/badge/icon/Docker?icon=docker&label)](https://https://docker.com/)

Alternatively, this repo could be run over a conda environment:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/shahrokh-bahtooei/intro-to-ml-tensorflow.git
cd intro-to-ml-tensorflow
conda env create --prefix ./env -f environment_minimal.yml
conda activate env/
jupyter notebook
```
